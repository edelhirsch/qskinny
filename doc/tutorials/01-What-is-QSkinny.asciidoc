:doctitle: 1. What is QSkinny?
:notitle:

*QSkinny is a UI framework based on the Qt graphic stack and written in
{cpp}. It allows users to write their UIs in {cpp} and/or QML.*

It is currently being used as the main technology for a UI for an agricultural
machine which is being used in production. In this project, there is no QML
used at all; the whole codebase is written in {cpp}. In general, using QML
together with QSkinny is possible though.

An overview of how QSkinny fits into the Qt architecture is depicted below:

.QSkinny sits on top of QtQuick, while QML is optional
